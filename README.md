Symfony 3 Simple Bootstrap
==========================

Welcome to this simple setup of a Symfony project.
It is meant to save some practises and tools I use often and keep track of my setup through time.
It's not perfect and might (will) contain mistakes.
If you ever see this project and want to comment, don't hesitate :)

For details on how to download and get started with Symfony, see the
[Installation][1] chapter of the Symfony Documentation.
